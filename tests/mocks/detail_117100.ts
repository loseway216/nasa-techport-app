        '<p>Within this year, we have completed the 2 GHz firmware design, which is the readout bandwidth capable of meeting PRIMA requirements for the 0.4--&gt;2.4 GHz spectrometer band.  We have also completed the 3 GHz firmware design, designed custom software to communicate with IF hardware components, and integrated the firmware with the PRIMA prototype MKIDs.  We’ve been baselined to provide the readout electronics for PRIMA.  Successful execution will position GSFC to meet the readout needs of future Flagship and Probe Space Telescopes that involve MKID Technologies.</p>  <p>The purpose of the Goddard Space Flight Center’s Internal Research and Development (IRAD) program is to support new technology development and to address scientific challenges.  Each year, Principal Investigators (PIs) submit IRAD proposals and compete for funding for their development projects.  Goddard’s IRAD program supports eight Lines of Business: Astrophysics; Communications and Navigation; Cross-Cutting Technology and Capabilities; Earth Science; Heliophysics; Planetary Science; Science Small Satellites Technology; and Suborbital Platforms and Range Services.</p>  <p>Task progress is evaluated twice a year at the Mid-term IRAD review and the end of the year. When the funding period has ended, the PIs compete again for IRAD funding or seek new sources of development and research funding, or agree to external partnerships and collaborations.  In some cases, when the development work has reached the appropriate Technology Readiness Level (TRL) level, the product is integrated into an actual NASA mission or used to support other government agencies. The technology may also be licensed out to the industry.</p>  <p>The completion of a project does not necessarily indicate that the development work has stopped.  The work could potentially continue in the future as a follow-on IRAD; or be used in collaboration or partnership with Academia, Industry, and other Government Agencies.</p>  <p>If you are interested in partnering with NASA, see the TechPort Partnerships documentation available on the TechPort Help tab. <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url&#61;http%3A%2F%2Ftechport.nasa.gov%2Fhelp&amp;data&#61;05%7C01%7Clauren.c.parker%40nasa.gov%7C4f37c175cba84130339608da90e2a8e3%7C7005d45845be48ae8140d43da96dd17b%7C0%7C0%7C637981600409935218%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata&#61;MSM%2BLeIn57sP%2Fyl3a5MJBz1iSTBnqlxsMVXs5kFo%2FZc%3D&amp;reserved&#61;0">http://techport.nasa.gov/help</a></p> ',
