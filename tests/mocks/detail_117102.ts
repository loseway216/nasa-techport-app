  benefits:
    "<p>The payoff to NASA is ultimately new information about the planets and moons of the outer solar system (especially Titan, but potentially also Uranus, Triton and others) to answer Decadal-Survey level fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of the solar system. The payoff to GSFC is participation in such a mission, including scientific involvement and engineering work, and also the development of a new line of instruments that may be proposed for multiple targets. FITR will answer high level questions from the 2022 Decadal Survey concerning the origin and evolution of the outer planets. This instrument is intended as payload principally for the Titan New Frontiers class orbiter but could be considered for the Uranus Flagship Orbiter Mission if very sensitive long wavelength detectors become available.</p> ",
  description:
    "<p>NASA GSFC has a strong heritage in the design and construction of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers for atmospheric remote sensing, beginning with the successful IRIS series of instruments (built from 1969-1977) and concluding in 1997 with the completion of the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). New remote sensing orbiter missions such as the Titan Orbiter prioritized in the latest (2022) Decadal Survey for Planetary Sciences prompt a re-investment in this instrument line, to provide competitive instrument proposals for flight opportunities expected to be announced in the ~5-7 year time horizon. We propose in FY23 to evaluate the performance of the existing CIRS-Lite hardware (developed under IRAD and PICASSO funding) in a laboratory environment, including also a new optical study (ODL) to design and quantify the optical path of the complete FTIR instrument.</p> ",

        '<p>During FY23 work was done to move the existing instrument testbed back from the GGAO Test Site to GSFC Building 34. This was completed in the spring. The instrument was then successfully tested for aliveness in the spring and summer. Spectra were recorded, and the instrument was assessed to need new electronics and computer interface to modernize the instrument and allow it to undergo further testing and upgrades.</p>  <p>The purpose of the Goddard Space Flight Center’s Internal Research and Development (IRAD) program is to support new technology development and to address scientific challenges.  Each year, Principal Investigators (PIs) submit IRAD proposals and compete for funding for their development projects.  Goddard’s IRAD program supports eight Lines of Business: Astrophysics; Communications and Navigation; Cross-Cutting Technology and Capabilities; Earth Science; Heliophysics; Planetary Science; Science Small Satellites Technology; and Suborbital Platforms and Range Services.</p>  <p>Task progress is evaluated twice a year at the Mid-term IRAD review and the end of the year. When the funding period has ended, the PIs compete again for IRAD funding or seek new sources of development and research funding, or agree to external partnerships and collaborations.  In some cases, when the development work has reached the appropriate Technology Readiness Level (TRL) level, the product is integrated into an actual NASA mission or used to support other government agencies. The technology may also be licensed out to the industry.</p>  <p>The completion of a project does not necessarily indicate that the development work has stopped.  The work could potentially continue in the future as a follow-on IRAD; or be used in collaboration or partnership with Academia, Industry, and other Government Agencies.</p>  <p>If you are interested in partnering with NASA, see the TechPort Partnerships documentation available on the TechPort Help tab. <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url&#61;http%3A%2F%2Ftechport.nasa.gov%2Fhelp&amp;data&#61;05%7C01%7Clauren.c.parker%40nasa.gov%7C4f37c175cba84130339608da90e2a8e3%7C7005d45845be48ae8140d43da96dd17b%7C0%7C0%7C637981600409935218%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata&#61;MSM%2BLeIn57sP%2Fyl3a5MJBz1iSTBnqlxsMVXs5kFo%2FZc%3D&amp;reserved&#61;0">http://techport.nasa.gov/help</a></p> ',
