    "<p>Beyond the NASA missions, the Harmonia-RPS capability has a strong business case due to the significant commercial demand for long lived lunar surface assets. Intuitive Machines (IM) will inform the RPS interface requirements and develop the lander design required to deliver an RPS-enabled IM lander capable of surviving and operating during the lunar night. Blue Origin will develop an interoperability standard so that the RSG can be integrated broadly into different government and commercial missions, from rovers to nodes to crewed applications. Blue Origin will also be responsible for the power system design and integration of the Stirling engine into an RPS, making it suitable for integration into any platform. Critically, given the long lived nature of Am-241, lunar surface heat sources can be recycled via this interoperability for decades, supporting Artemis sustainability. The target markets for the proposed technology range from equatorial regions to permanently shadowed regions, at a competitive cost.  <br /> </p>",
  description:
    "<p>The Harmonia-Radioisotoper Power System (RPS) Tipping Point (TP) Project develops a Stirling Engine-enabled radioisotope power system that utilizes a long-lived, thermally constant heat source – Americium-241 (Am-241). The design will include a modular radioisotope power system that produces at least 10 We to potentially power an Intuitive Machine's lunar lander and enable long-duration access to lunar surface destinations, including surviving the night capability and long mission durations in crater areas. In addition, it will have plug-and-play capabilities to power multiple surface support equipment (rovers, diggers, communication systems, etc.) over various Artemis missions. Through this project, the team will mature an Am-241 heat source through final design and deliver an electrically heated power system compatible with Americium-241 and other fuel sources. This project will conduct a Technology Readiness Assessment to baseline the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) at the start of the Project and aim to mature the technology to a TRL 6 at the completion. With the addition of a radioisotope heat sources, the RPS can proceed immediately into production.</p><p>Harmonia-class radioisotope power systems can directly support crewed Artemis missions as the Radioisotope Stirling Generator (RSG) can be set up, refueled, and maintained by astronauts. Harmonia-class RPS technology directly aligns with the requirements that contribute to Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and NASA's broader science, technology and exploration objectives. Other important national objectives include the near-term demonstration of Stirling conversion for an RPS, as recommended in the recent Planetary Science Decadal Survey, and the commercial development of space nuclear power systems per Space Policy Directive-6. Compared to the “state of the art,\" Harmonia will establish an affordable private-sector radioisotope capability, supporting new government and commercial applications.<br /> </p><p> </p>",
