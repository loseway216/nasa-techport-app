  benefits:
    "<p>The CTE-A technology offers the prospect to reduce mass and improve performance over current state of the art. The project is working to develop advanced multifunctional tank constructions applicable to lightweight structures used on Human Lander Systems (HLS), launch vehicles and lunar/on-orbit fuel depots. The objective is to reduce mass by 10% (threshold) to 30% (stretch) and reduce the level of boil off experienced. There is the potential to save 50 to 100 pounds for lander architectures and upwards of 500 pounds for NTP applications.  These mass savings are a 1:1 ratio between savings and payload. Another objective is to understand and measure the system level permeation, demonstrate and quantify thermal performance improvements and understand integrated attachment concepts to minimize heat leaks. Another benefit that the project will provide is composite material property data in a cryogen environment. The properties needed for habitat or long-term field application are scarce at LOX and LH2 temperatures.<br /><br /> </p><p><br /><br /> </p><p> </p>",
  description:
    "<p>A key technology for space exploration including extended lunar missions and lunar surface systems operations is the maturation and demonstration of large-scale lightweight composite fuel storage tanks and associated support structure and penetrations. Spacecraft may exceed mass and volume limits. Development needs for a composite tank include integration of multi-layer insulation (MLI) with micro-meteoroid protection, tank support structure/isolators, other penetrations and development for all composite and/or composite with a metallic inner liner, mitigation of permeability, design, analysis/modeling, material properties at cryogen temperatures and manufacturing processes. Challenges to be addressed include long-term storage of cryogens, micro-cracking, composite/metal interfaces, and permeation (measurement and testing). The CTE-A project plans to mature and demonstrate through public/private partnerships advanced technologies to reduce cost and weight of composite/hybrid cryotanks and increase readiness level of light-weight tanks for infusion into exploration systems including landers, depots and surface infrastructure. The project will advance NASA's and industry's position with respect to cryogenic composite tanks by developing material property data and compatibility assessments for long duration service life, performing design trade studies and down selecting potential demonstration permeability/boiloff test articles, and integrating previously developed technologies to reduce boil off for use with tank architectures. There are three focus areas for the CTE-A project. The first area is materials properties at cryogenic temperatures. Composite material properties at cryogenic (LOX and/or LH2) temperatures are scarce. The second area is optimized structural supports for cryogenic storage applications. Thermally optimized structural supports would address a critical issue with long term cryogenic storage and would provide synergistic benefits to composite tanks for cryogenic storage. The third area is cost effective permeability test methods. Cost of current permeability test methods have increased over the last several years.</p><p> </p>",
