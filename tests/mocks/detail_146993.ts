  benefits:
    "<p>ORCA benefits include: Modern evolved-additive alloys that will allow for significant improvements in performance and processing (ie. optimized for AM); Improved surface finish to provide optimal performance. Surface finish is critical for flow and fatigue performance but has limited characterization for aerospace alloys and internal flow passages, where AM is most often used (chambers, turbomachinery); Improve success with long duration builds by eliminating build failures and reducing residual stresses; Enable first time thru manufacturing by developing advanced materials and process modeling/validation. ORCA addresses the longest lead times, highest costs, and heaviest components in the development, build, and test of rocket engines.<br />This maturation of AM will support the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Strategic Framework in all thrust areas of Go, Live and Explore and benefit NASA's science and exploration missions. This project specifically aligns with NASA's taxonomies TX01 Propulsion Systems; TX01.1 Chemical Space Propulsion; TX01.1.3 Cryogenic and TX12.1.4 Materials for Extreme Environments.<br /> </p>",
  description:
    "<p> </p><p>The Optimized and Repeatable Components in Additive-manufacturing (ORCA) project builds upon the successful evolution of additive manufacturing (AM) core technology under the Low-Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP)  and Rapid Analysis and Manufacturing Propulsion Technology (RAMPT) projects for liquid rocket components and provides high payoff optimized performance technologies and enabling materials in AM for combustion chambers, injectors, nozzles, and turbomachinery. NASA has helped transform additive manufacturing and complex applications of the AM technology through process and material development and successful infusion into industry including a successful flight test of technology elements from RAMPT. Some fundamental enhancements required to allow the full infusion of AM to optimize performance for current and future missions are:</p><p>1)     Advanced development of AM post-processing surface enhancement/polishing techniques for internal surfaces  across multiple components are required to improve flow performance and ensure repeatable mechanical (fatigue) properties.</p><p>2)     AM materials and composite-reinforced material systems for large scale propulsion applications must sustain high performance under extreme oxygen-rich, high pressure, and high temperature environments</p><p>3)     Advanced materials and  process AM digital model twin development and validation will lead to efficient and repeatable part fabrication and the ability to predict residual stress as a function of process parameters and geometry.</p><p>Two areas for alloy development have been identified for rocket engine applications. The first is a higher temperature alloy for applications such as injectors and turbopumps. NASA 's GRX- 810 has been identified as a candidate alloy for these applications. The other is oxygen compatible alloys for oxygen-rich staged combustion cycles. No commercial alloy has thus far shown sufficient oxygen compatibility in the extreme environment to meet this application and is an ongoing challenge in new engine development. Alloy development will likely be required.</p><p>ORCA addresses the longest lead times, highest costs, and heaviest components in the development, build, and test of rocket engines. ORCA technology development is applicable to Lunar Lander Engine, Booster Engines, Upper Stage Engines, Commercial Space Engine Technology, and Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) technology. This project will utilize public-private partnerships and cost sharing with specialty industry vendors, government partners, commercial crew providers, and infusion into commercial space companies and manufacturers.<br /> </p><p><br /><br /> </p>",
